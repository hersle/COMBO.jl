  abstract = {We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high signal-to-noise HST data, and spectra of six SNe Ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented. Additionally, for the two SNe with z{$>$}1, we present ground-based J-band photometry from Gemini and the VLT. These are among the most distant SNe Ia for which ground based near-IR observations have been obtained. We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008). We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557 supernovae, the Union2 compilation. The flat concordance LambdaCDM model remains an excellent fit to the Union2 data with the best fit constant equation of state parameter w=-0.997\^\{+0.050\}\_\{-0.054\} (stat) \^\{+0.077\}\_\{-0.082\} (stat+sys\textbackslash{} together) for a flat universe, or w=-1.035\^\{+0.055\}\_\{-0.059\} (stat)\^\{+0.093\}\_\{-0.097\} (stat+sys together) with curvature. We also present improved constraints on w(z). While no significant change in w with redshift is detected, there is still considerable room for evolution in w. The strength of the constraints depend strongly on redshift. In particular, at z {$>$} 1, the existence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data.},

Beginning with the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, this trusted resource includes careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. The reader is then introduced to perturbations about an FLRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their primordial generation by inflation, and their observational consequences: the acoustic peaks in the CMB; the E/B decomposition in polarization; gravitational lensing of the CMB and large-scale structure; and the BAO standard ruler and redshift-space distortions in galaxy clustering. The Second Edition now also covers nonlinear structure formation including perturbation theory and simulations. The book concludes with a substantially updated chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology, Second Edition, shows how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe, and supplies readers with all the tools needed to work in cosmology.--},

  abstract = {Consistency checks of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM predictions with current cosmological data sets may illuminate the types of changes needed to resolve cosmological tensions. To this end, we modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to create phenomenological amplitudes, similar to the lensing amplitude parameter \$A\_L\$, for the Sachs-Wolfe, Doppler, early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW), and Polarization contributions to the CMB temperature anisotropy, and then we include these additional amplitudes in fits to the Planck TT power spectrum. We find that allowing one of these amplitudes to vary at a time results in little improvement over \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM alone suggesting that each of these physical effects are being correctly accounted for given the current level of precision. Further, we find that the only pair of phenomenological amplitudes that results in a significant improvement to the fit to Planck temperature data results from varying the amplitudes of the Sachs-Wolfe and Doppler effects simultaneously. However, we show that this model is really just refinding the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$A\_L\$ solution. We test adding our phenomenological amplitudes as well as \$N\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{eff\}\}\$, \$Y\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{He\}\}\$, and \$n\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{run\}\}\$ to \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$A\_L\$ and find that none of these model extensions provide significant improvement over \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM + \$A\_L\$ when fitting Planck temperature data. Finally, we quantify the contributions of both the eISW effect and lensing on the constraint of the physical matter density from Planck temperature data by allowing the phenomenological amplitude from each effect to vary. We find that these effects play a relatively small role (the uncertainty increases by \$3.5\textbackslash\%\$ and \$16\textbackslash\%\$ respectively) suggesting that the overall photon envelope has the greatest constraining power.},

  abstract = {Current cosmological observations show a strong signature of the existence of a dark energy component with negative pressure. The most obvious candidate for this dark energy is the cosmological constant (with the equation of state w\_X=p/\textbackslash rho=-1), which, however, raises several theoretical difficulties. This has led to models for dark energy component which evolves with time. We discuss certain questions related to the determination of the nature of dark energy component from observations of high redshift supernova. The main results of our analysis are: (i) Even if the precise value of w\_X is known from observations, it is not possible to determine the nature of the unknown dark energy source using only kinematical and geometrical measurements. We have given explicit examples to show that different types of sources can give rise to a given w\_X. (ii) Although the full data set of supernova observations (which are currently available) strongly rule out models without dark energy, the high (z{$>$}0.25) and low (z{$<$}0.25) redshift data sets, individually, admit decelerating models with zero dark energy. Any possible evolution in the absolute magnitude of the supernovae, if detected, might allow the decelerating models to be consistent with the data. (iii) We have introduced two parameters, which can be obtained entirely from theory, to study the sensitivity of the luminosity distance on w\_X. Using these two parameters, we have argued that although one can determine the present value of w\_X accurately from the data, one cannot constrain the evolution of w\_X.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.
